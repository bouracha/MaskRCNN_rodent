# MaskRCNN_rodent
Here I use transfer learning on the MaskRCNN code (using the coco weights) to learn object detection and segmentation for rodents. This was for a specific project where I needed isolate single rodents from a video of a cage with multiple rodents. This was achieved by using the learned rodent (object) detection's bounding box as a single frame in a new cropped video for which bounding boxes were linked together if an aggregated metric of their confidence of detection and separation of centroids was below some hyperparameter-like tuned value. Importantly, we also end videos when two bounding boxes collide. The result of this is a collection of videos that follow only one rodent. The code for this is in extract_cideos.py.
